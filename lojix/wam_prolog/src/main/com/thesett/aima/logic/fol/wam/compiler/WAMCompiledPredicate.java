/**
 * A compiled term is a handle onto a compiled down to binary code term. Compiled terms are not Java code and may be
 * executed outside of the JVM, but the Java retains a handle on them and provides sufficient wrapping around them that
 * they can be made to look as if they are a transparent abstract syntax tree within the JVM. This requires an ability
 * to decompile a clause back into its abstract syntax tree.
 *
 * <p/>Decompilation of functors requires access to a mapping from registers to variables, but the variable to register
 * assignment is created at compile time accross a whole clause. Each functor that forms part of the clause head or body
 * must therefore hold a link to its containing functor in order to access this mapping.

 * @author Rupert Smith
 * @todo   For each functor in the head and body, set this as the containing clause. A mapping from variables to
 *         registers is maintained in the clause, and the functors need to be able to access this mapping.
