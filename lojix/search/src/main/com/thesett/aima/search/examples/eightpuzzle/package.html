The eight puzzle is often used as a bench mark or first test for search algorithms because its search space is small 
enough to be exhaustively explored but large enough to provide a reaasonably complex test space to test out different
search algorithms on. The puzzle consists of numbered tiles, 1 to 8, arranged in a 3 by 3 grid with one square empty.
Tiles may only move by sliding into the empty square. The aim is to arrange the tiles like this:

<p/><table>
<tr><td>1<td>2<td>3
<tr><td>4<td>5<td>6
<tr><td>7<td>8<td>E
</table>

<p/>Another popular variation of the goal state is:

<p/><table>
<tr><td>1<td>2<td>3
<tr><td>8<td>E<td>4
<tr><td>7<td>6<td>5
</table>

Two heuristics used to guide the search are the number of tiles out of place and the total manhattan distance of the out
of place tiles to their goal locations. The manhattan distance is the total number of horizontal and vertical moves a tile
must make to arrive in its place. A manhattan distnace heuristic is supplied in this package. It can compute the total
distance from scratch or incrementally from a previous board position with a move applied to it. This technique of
incremental heuristics is possible because search node to calculate a hearustic for is always passed along with the 
actual state to calculate it for. The search node can be used to obtain its parent state and the operation applied
to get to it, making incremental calculation possible. This can often be a very significant time saver.
