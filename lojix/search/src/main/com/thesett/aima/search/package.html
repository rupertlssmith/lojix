This package defines what a search node is and some basic queue based algorithms for searching over them. 

<p/>The basic algorithm is the queue search algorithm that uses a queue to order its search nodes and simply selects the 
next node from that queue until the goal state is found. 

<p/>The max steps algorithm refines this by limiting the search to complete within a maximum number of steps.

<p/>The bound algorithm allows some property of the states being searched over to be bounded and to only search up
to that bound.

<p/>The iterative bound algorithm allows repeated searching up to a bound that increases iteratively on succesive calls
to the algorithm.

<p/>A search is created from these basic algorithms by adding a queue and a search node type to it to produce a search.
For example, a last in first out queue will result in a bradth first search and a last in last out queue will result in
depth first. Simple search nodes do not guide the search but heuristic nodes can be used with ordered queues to produce
more sophisticated searches. For exmaple a greedy search uses heuristic nodes and a queue order on the heuristic values 
such that the node with the best heuristic value is always on top of the queue and explored first.
