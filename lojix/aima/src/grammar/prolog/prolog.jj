/*
 * This is an implementation of a parser for the first order logic based language, Prolog. In its
 * purest form, this language consists of terms in first order logic, posed either as programs (to
 * be added to a store), or queries (to be matched against the store).
 *
 * The lanaguage consists of the following possible sentences:
 *
 * Program terms are clauses (or constants), terminated with a '.'.
 * Programs can be facts or rules of the form: a0 :- a1, ..., an. Facts consist only of the head a0
 * with no following ':-'. Rules have a body consisting of: a1,...,an. The 'a1' to 'an' are additional
 * queries that must be satisfied and unified, with variables scoped over the entire rule, including
 * its head.
 * Queries are of the form ?- a0,...,an. Variable are scoped over the entire query and each part of
 * it must be consecutively unified against matching programs, building up a unification over all of
 * the variables in the queries scope, the same as for program bodies. Queries and program bodies are
 * essentially the same thing, the only difference being that entering a query indicates that it
 * should be run immediately, whereas a program body is only run when its head is matched.
 *
 * Variables are scoped within the current sentence only; fresh ones are generated within the scope
 * for each new variable name encountered. Variables never span multiple sentence scopes.
 *
 * There are some commands that may be passed to the interpreter, that are system directives outside
 * of the usual interpreter loop.
 * These are:
 *
 * [info]  To turn info logging on/off.
 * [trace] To turn execution tracing on/off.
 * [user]  To enter 'user' mode, where programs can be entered.
