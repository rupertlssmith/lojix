This package defines the interfaces that are common to all learning methods and classifying machines. A learning method
is an algorithm that takes some learning data and a classifying machine to train and that produces a classifying machine
that can perform a classification on the data that is better than the original machine.

<p/>Central to the learning interfaces described here is the state object that holds any data set as a collection of
named properties. See the uk.co.thebaderset.state package for more information about the state model.
