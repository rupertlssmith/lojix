Provides 'uninformed' search algorithms. These do not make use of heuristics to guide the search. The following
algorithms can be found in this package:

<p/><ul>
<li>Depth first search.
<li>Depth bounded search. Searches up to a depth limit.
<li>Iterative deepening search. Searches depth first to an interatively increasing depth limit. This is a complete
    search like breadth first search and only marginally slower than breadth first. It has the advantage over breadth 
    first that it does not need to keep a huge list of unexpanded nodes in memory so is much more space efficient
    than breadth first.
<li>Uniform cost search. Follows the search node that has the lowest path cost. The boundary of the search will have a
    roughly uniform cost.
<li>Cost bounded search. Searches up to a cost limit.
<li>Iterative cost increasing search. Searches using cost limits that increase in steps or to the next available level.
</ul>
