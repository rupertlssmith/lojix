Provides 'heuristic' or 'informed' search algorithms. The following algorithms can be found in this package:

<p/><ul>
<li>Greedy Search. Always takes the node with the best heurisitc first.
<li>A-Star Search. Always takes the node with the highest f value first (where f = heuristic + cost).
<li>Iterative Deepening A-Star Search. Same as A-Star but proceeds iteratively with increasing values of f.
<li>F-Bounded Search. Searches up to an f limit (where f = heuristic + cost).
</ul>

<p/>For an admissable heuristic the A-Star algorithm is guaranteed to find the lowest cost path to the goal.
