A prototype decision tree learning algorithm and matching evaluation machine can be found in this package. The decision
tree learning algorithm was coded from pseudo-code taken from the AIMA book. It does not provide any sophisticated 
features such as the ability to use different decision preference methods, to compensate for missing data fields in the
learning set or live data, or to convert non-discrete data into discrete data. Time and space efficiency has not been
developed to an advanced degree in this prototype algorithm either.

Learning procedes by selecting the decision that maximizes the information gain on the property of the training data to
be learned.
