/**
 * An L1CompiledFunctor is a {@link Functor} which has been compiled to byte code. In order to implement the methods of
 * {@link Functor}, to be traversable as an abstract syntax tree, the byte code needs to be decompiled to restore the
 * abstract syntax tree of the original. The byte code for queries and program statements is compiled differently, hence
 * this class abstracts out the common part of the decompilation process and delegates some of it to the conrete
 * sub-classes.
 *
 * <p/>A compiled functor is always in the context of an {@link L1Machine}, which holds its byte code in its code area
 * and which contains the symbol tables for converting interned functors and variable names back into strings. Interned
 * variable names are discarded at compile time, unlike functor names which are encoded into the instructions. Variables
 * within the context of a functor instance are compiled to a particular register, so to recover the variables that are
 * assigned during unification or to decompile functors from byte code, a mapping from registers to variable names is
 * needed. This is stored in the compiled functor as an array of integers, indexed by registers.
 *
 * <p/>Decompiling the byte code to recover the abstract syntax tree, may seem unnecessary, because the code was
 * compiled from such a tree, which could have been retained. It is done to make it possible to load byte code from a
 * file, once the original syntax tree has been discarded, and recover that tree in order to manipulate and query the
 * code through its syntax tree. This also means that writing a decompiler tool for the language will be trivial and
 * part of its toolset from the outset.
 *
 * <p/>Queries are compiled in two passes, one using a bread first ordering to write out register value for parts of the
 * query out-in, and one to generate the instructions for a query in a post-fix order, such that arguments are
 * instantiated in registers, in-out, before their enclosing functors are encountered. The resulting instruction stream
 * loads values into registers, then writes out the functor, then writes out the arguments to the functor from the
 * loaded register. This combination of forward and backward phases means that when decompiling queries the isntruction
 * stream is explored in reverse, with forward exploration to extract the registers that hold a query functors
 * arguments. Program functors can be decompiled with forward exploration only.
 *
 * <p/>The decompilation process has been written using 3 passes over the instruction stream. The first pass walks over
 * the stream, picking out the offsets of all put_struc instructions, which identify the functors in the instructions.
 * The second pass walks over the instruction stream, using the functor instruction offsets from the first step. The
 * first step is done because an instruction argument could have the same value as the put_struc instruction, so a
 * backward pass (in the case of queries) cannot differentiate between instructions and arguments without the first
 * step. In pass two, every register write-out or unify instruction results in a pending value for later completion to
 * be added to the functors arguments in step 3. Every functor, or variable creation results in a new functor or
 * variable being created, and noting which register it is loaded into. The third pass walks recursively down the
 * abstract syntax tree, filling in all arguments pending completion from the register load instructions.

 * @todo   Instead of copying the byte code out of the machine, before decompiling it. Use a ref to a byte[] and and
 *         offset and length. Then for the Java machine can just use offset/length into the code buffer in the machine.
 *         For native machine, with direct buffers, doing a bulk copy before the finer byte by byte iteration over the
 *         code will be faster. So do copy it out and use a zero offset on the fresh array. Need to pass down offset
 *         parameter into decompilation methods.
