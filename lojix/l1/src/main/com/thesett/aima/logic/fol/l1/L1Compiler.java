/**
 * L1Compiled implements a compiler for the logical language, L1, into a form suitable for passing to an
 * {@link L1Machine}. The L1Machine accepts sentences in the language that are compiled into a byte code form. The byte
 * instructions used in the compiled language are enumerated as constants in the {@link L1InstructionSet} class.
 *
 * <p/>The compilation process is described in "Warren's Abstact Machine, A Tutorial Reconstruction, by Hassan Ait-Kaci"
 * and is followed as closely as possible to the L1 compiler given there. The description of the L0 compilation process
 * is very clear in the text but the L1 compilation is a little ambiguous. It does not fully describe the flattening
 * process and presents some conflicting examples of register assignment. (The flattening process is essentially the
 * same as for L0, except that each argument of the outermost functor is flattened/compiled independently). The register
 * assignment process is harder to fathom, on page 22, the register assignment for p(Z, h(Z,W), f(W)) is presented with
 * the following assignment given:
 *
 * <pre>
 * A1 = Z
 * A2 = h(A1,X4)
 * A3 = f(X4)
 * X4 = W
 * </pre>
 *
 * In figure 2.9 a compilation example is given, from which it can be seen that the assignment should be:
 *
 * <pre>
 * A1 = Z (loaded from X4)
 * A2 = h(X4,X5)
 * A3 = f(X5)
 * X4 = Z
 * X5 = W
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p/>From figure 2.9 it was concluded that argument registers may only be assigned to functors. Functors can be
 * created on the heap and assigned to argument registers directly. Argument registers for variables, should be loaded
 * from a separate register assigned to the variable, that comes after the argument registers; so that a variable
 * assignment can be copied into multiple arguments, where the same variable is presented multiple times in a predicate
 * call. The register assignment process is carried out in two phases to do this, the first pass covers the argument
 * registers and the arguments of the outermost functor, only assigning to functors, the second pass continues for
 * higher numbered registers, starts again at the begining of the arguments, and assigns to variables and functors (not
 * already assigned) as for the L0 process.
 *
 * <p/>A brief overview of the compilation process is:
 *
 * <pre><p/><ul>
 * <li>Terms to be compiled are allocated registers, breadth first, enumerating from outermost functors down to
 *     inermost atoms or variables.</li>
 * <li>The outermost functor itself is treated specially, and is not allocated to a register. Its i arguments are
 *     allocated to registers, and are additionaly associated with the first i argument registers. The outermost
 *     functor is the instigator of a call, in the case of queries, or the recipient of a call, in the case of programs.
 * <li>Queries are 'flattened' by traversing each of their arguments in postfix order of their functors, then exploring
 *     the functors arguments.</li>
 * <li>Programs are 'flattened' by traversing each of their arguments breadth first, the same as for the original
 *     register allocation, then exploring the functors arguments.</li>
 * </ul></pre>
 *
 * <p/>Query terms are compiled into a sequence of instructions, that build up a representation of their argument terms,
 * to be unified, on the heap, and assigning registers to refer to those terms on the heap, then calling the matching
 * program for the query terms name and arity. Program terms are compiled into a sequence of instructions that, when run
 * against the argument registers, attempt to unify all of the arguments with the heap.
 *
 * <p/>The effect of flattening queries using a post fix ordering, is that the values of inner functors and variables
 * are loaded into registers first, before their containing functor is executed, which writes the functor and its
 * arguments onto the heap. Programs do not need to be expanded in this way, they simply match functors followed by
 * their arguments against the heap, so a breadth first traversal is all that is needed.
 *
 * <p/>Evaluating a flattened query consists of doing the following as different query tokens are encountered:
 *
 * <pre><p/><ol>
 * <li>For the outermost functor, process all arguments, then make a CALL (functor) to the matching program.
 * <li>For a register associated with an inner functor, push an STR onto the heap and copy that cell into the register.
 *     A put_struc (functor, register) instruction is created for this.</li>
 * <li>For a variable in argument position i in the outermost functor, push a REF onto the heap that refers to iself,
 *     and copy that value into that variables register, as well as argument register i. A put_var (register, register)
 *     instruction is emmitted for this.
 * <li>For a register argument of an inner functor, not previously seen, push a REF onto the heap that refers to itself,
 *     and copy that cell into the register. A set_var (register) instruction is emmitted for this.</li>
 * <li>For a variables in argument position i in the outermost functor, previosly seen, copy its assigned register
 *     into its argument register. A put_val (register, register) instruction is emmitted for this.</li>
 * <li>For a register argument previously seen, push a new cell onto the heap and copy into it the register's value.
 *     A set_val (register) instruction is emmitted for this.</li>
 * </ol></pre>
 *
 * <p/>Evaluating a flattened program consists of doing the following as different program tokens are encountered:
 *
 * <pre><p/><ol>
 * <li>For the outermost functor, process all arguments, then execute a PROCEED instruction to indicate success.
 * <li>For a register associated with an inner functor, load that register with a reference to the functor. A get_struc
 *     (functor, register) instruction is created for this.</li>
 * <li>For a variable in argument position i in the outermost functor, copy its argument register into its assigned
 *     rgister. A get_var (register, register) instruction is emmitted for this.
 * <li>For a register argument of an innter functor, not previously seen, bind that register to its argument. A
 *     unify_var (register) instruction is output for this.</li>
 * <li>For a variable in argument position i in the outermost functor, unify its assigned register with the
 *     argument register. A get_val (register, register) instruction is emmitted for this.</li>
 * <li>For a register argument of an inner functor, previously seen, unify that register against the heap. A
 *     unify_val (register) instruction is emmitted for this.</li>
