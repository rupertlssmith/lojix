/**
 * L1UnifyingMachine is a unifier for the first order logical language L1. It unifies a query against all of its stored
 * programs, outputing the unifications that it finds.
 *
 * <p/>The {@link L1Compiler} outputs byte code that this {@link L1Machine} understands. All instructions have one byte
 * for the opcode, and one byte for the register. The put_struc and get_struc instructions also take an additional
 * functor reference which is an integer enumeration of the functor's particular name and arity. The instruction size
 * and format is therefore, two bytes, followed by an optional 4-byte integer.
 *
 * <p/>This machine builds up queries to be unified on the heap, then executes a program against that heap, to check for
 * unification.
