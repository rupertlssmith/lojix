/**
 * L1UnifyingNativeMachine is a byte code interpreter for L1 implemented externally as native code. The code here is a
 * wrapper for the native library. It provides a method to get an instance of this l1 machine that can throw a checked
 * exception when the native library is not available.
 *
 * <p/>The other interesting feature of this machine, is that the byte code is passed to the native library in a direct
 * byte buffer. The intention is that the compiler (or in the future a loader) outputs compiled code into the machine
 * which holds it in a direct byte buffer. No copying accross will be done prior to execution.
