/**
 * L0UnifyingMachine is a unifier for the first order logical language L0. It unifies a query against all of its stored
 * programs, outputing the unifications that it finds.
 *
 * <p/>The {@link L0Compiler} outputs byte code that this machine understands. All instructions have one byte for the
 * opcode, and one byte for the register. The put_struc and get_struc instructions also take an additional functor
 * reference which is an integer enumeration of the functor's particular name and arity. The instruction size and format
 * is therefore, two bytes, followed by an optional 4-byte integer.
 *
 * <p/>This machine builds up queries to be unified on the heap, then executes a program against that heap, to check for
 * unification.
