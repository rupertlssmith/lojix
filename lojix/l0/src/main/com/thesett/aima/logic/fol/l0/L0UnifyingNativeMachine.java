/**
 * L0UnifyingNativeMachine is a byte code interpreter for L0 implemented externally as native code. The code here is
 * just a wrapper for the native library. It provides a method to get an instance of this l0 machine that can throw a
 * checked exception when the native library is not available.
 *
 * <p/>The other interesting feature of this machine, is that the byte code is passed to the native library in a direct
 * byte buffer. The instructions are copied out to the direct byte buffer from a byte array within the JVM, so there is
 * no speed advantage to doing this. It is done, because in the implementations of languages beyond L0, the byte code
 * machine has a 'code area' which holds the compiled code. The intention is that the compiler (or loader) will output
 * code into a direct byte buffer on the native machine, and no copying accross will be done prior to execution. The
 * direct byte buffer technique was used here to experiment with this idea.
