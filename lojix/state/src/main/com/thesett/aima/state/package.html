Defines data sets and the differnt kinds of data attribute values that can go in them.

<p/>The State class defines what a single data point is. Essentially it is a collection of data values with one special
boolean value called the goal value. Not all state spaces need define a goal attribute but it is used frequently enough 
to be made a special attribute and can be ignored when not needed.

<p/>The attributes themselves are defined is classes that wrap other Java types or user defined types and where possible, 
that is, when they define a data value that is discrete, they provide methods to say how many possible values the data
attribute can take on and what those possible values are. It is helpful for search or learning algorithms to know what
possible values a data value can take on because this limits the search space or learning space to be over just that
set of values.
