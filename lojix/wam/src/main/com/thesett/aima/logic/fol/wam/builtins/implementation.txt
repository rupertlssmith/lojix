=== Cut

neck_cut or cut, ok to insert that correctly.
get_depth a little annoying, as needs to be part of the clause prefix instructions. also complicated the assignment
of permanent registers.

=== Call

Argument to call is built on the heap, or stack.

Call is implemented as a procedure that takes the argument, and turns it into a call, that is built args on heap, assign
argument registers, call.

Is it necessary to build a complete copy of the arguments on the heap, or can an argument register be set to point into
the existing structure?

=== Unifies

Create LHS as query parameters.
Create RHS as program parameters.
No call instruction, just run the 2 together.

OR

Implement as:

=(X, X).
\=(X, Y) :- \+(X = Y).

=== Disjunction

Does this complicate permanent register assignment? Yes, but use the same procedure to count the number of permanent
registers, just include nested conjunctive/disjunctive top-level terms in the count.

 Problems with current inline implementations:

 try_me/retry_me Saves the argument registers of the current clause. In the inline case, another clause may have been
called prior to this, in which case num_args is set wrong. Need num_args for this predicate, not any that might have
been called in between.
